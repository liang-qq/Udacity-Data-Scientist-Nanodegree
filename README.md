**Project Motivation**

This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course project: Write A Data Science Blog Post.
In this project I performed the exploratory data analysis to the Airbnb Seattle, trying to answer the three questions below:
•	What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle in cost perspective?
•	Which neighbourhood in Seattle is the most popular place for lodging?
•	Should tourist choose listings with longer business history or shorter? 

**File Descriptions**

There is one notebook available here to show coding work related to the above questions. Comments and markdown cells were used to 
help walking through the thought process.

**Results**

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mitbbskg/explotary-data-analysis-to-airbnb-listing-in-seattle-8c0bffd96237).

**Technical Requirements**

The coding is written in Jupyter Notebook. Please be sure the libraries of Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib are installed before running the code.

**Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.**

Must give credit to Airbnbfor the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link 
available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
